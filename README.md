This program was written through the terminal without an IDE.

Data of type floats and int32_t will be fed into a function and will be 
displayed into a histogram.

A Makefile file was created for easy compilation and linking. 

input.txt was created with data points. This (the output of input.txt) was piped into the input of the
functions that were created and the data was displayed accordingly.

Files were zipped and encrypted also through the terminal.
